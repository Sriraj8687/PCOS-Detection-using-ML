# üß† PCOS Detection and Classification using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect and classify Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using clinical, hormonal, and lifestyle data. The goal is to support early diagnosis and empower medical professionals with predictive insights.

# üîç Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, label encoding, feature scaling, and correlation analysis for feature selection.

Model Training: Implementation of multiple supervised learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics: Models evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation.

Model Explainability: SHAP analysis and feature importance plots to interpret model decisions.

# üìä Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized medical records of women with and without PCOS, featuring parameters such as BMI, insulin levels, FSH, LH ratio, number of follicles, and menstrual cycle history.

# üè• Objective
To create a reliable, interpretable, and scalable classification system that aids in early detection of PCOS and enhances clinical decision-making.
